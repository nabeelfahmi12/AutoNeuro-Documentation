# Logger

#### When you want to configure logging for your project, you should do it as soon as possible when the program starts. If app.logger is accessed before logging is configured, it will add a default handler. If possible, configure logging before creating the application object.
```python
class AppLogger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.now = datetime.now()
        self.date = self.now.date()
        self.current_time = self.now.strftime("%H:%M:%S")

    def log(self, file_object, log_message):
        """This method will be used for logger all the information to the file."""

        file_object.write(
            str(self.date) + "/" + str(self.current_time) + "\t\t" + log_message + "\n")
```
