# Code Examples
Our code examples are short.

All of our examples are written as Jupyter notebooks and can be run in one click in Google Colab, a hosted notebook environment that requires no setup and runs in the cloud. Google Colab includes GPU and TPU runtimes.

* [k-Nearest Neighbors](Examples/k-nearest.md)<br>
* [Support Vector Machines(SVM)](Examples/svm.md)<br>
* [Decision Trees and Random Forests](Examples/decision_tree.md)<br>


### Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Adding A new code example
We welcome new code examples! Here are our rules:

1. They should be shorter than 300 lines of code (comments may be as long as you want).</li>
1. They should demonstrate modern Keras / TensorFlow 2.0 best practices.</li>
1. They should be substantially different in topic from all examples listed above.</li>
1. They should be extensively documented & commented.</li>

New examples are added via Pull Requests to the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Jhansi-27/Sample_Auto) repository.
They must be submitted as a .py file that follows a specific format. They are usually generated from Jupyter notebooks.
